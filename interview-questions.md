# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is a software native to the apple OS which allows version control for files locally on the computer. Github is an online resource which interacts with git to allow multiple users to simultaneously work on and update files, under the protection of version control. 

  Researched answer: git is an open source software (available for several different OS's) which allows for version control of projects of varying sizes and scopes. Github is a free code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.


2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The phrasing of this question kind of confused to me. I'm interpreting this as asking for which operators can be used to give Boolean values. The following operators will yield Boolean values: <, <=, >, >=, !=, !==, ==, ===, ||, and &&. In addition, the || and && operators can be chained together for evaluating multiple statements, which will result in a single Boolean value.

  Researched answer: I tried googling this question and did not get much clarity as to what is being asked here. Based on the syllabus, these operators all fall under two categories: relational and logical operators. I'm wondering if this is what is being asked instead.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: The index is a reference value for the position of a given value within an array or string. It can be used to return a value from an array or string by using square brackets. A value, in the case of arrays and strings, is stored in a particular position. I think of the relationship they have in terms of simple functions: The index can be considered the input, the value the output. 

  Researched answer: From the syllabus, indexes are sequential numbers which define the position of values within an array or string. The value is what is stored at the position. I did some research and didn't find anything else that was interesting. 



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is a process which loops use to incrementally execute a statement as long as certain conditions are satisfied. A typical loop will run through a finite number of iterations. They can use a combination of either harded coded values or variables to determine how many iterations are done via the starting and ending conditions.

  Researched answer: The syllabus says iteration is the process of executing a block of code over and over again until a condition is met. I'd argue a loop is actually executing code while a certain condition is met (ie the second statement being true) but I guess it's kind of a petty distinction.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is process by which two programmers work in two different roles to produce one single code. The roles should be swapped periodically to make sure both coders can see each other's perspectives. There are two roles: driver and navigator. The driver is the only person working on the code at a given time. They are responsible for maintaining the code and listening to the navigator for making decisions. The navigator does not code, but instead looks over the code while the driver is coding to find typos and help make decisions and/or suggestions. 

  Researched answer: Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation, either remotely or locally.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Going over Github in extreme detail was a good idea. It's one of those things that needs a lot of practice to be understood. I think a lot of people are still struggling with it (I think mainly with just memorizing all of the commands), but it's probably better to struggle with it now rather than while we're working on our capstone projects.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request: GitHub pull requests are a way for others to see what changes you have made to your code in your branch. It allows for discussion of said changes prior to them being pulled up into the parent branch. Once the changes are agreed upon, the pull request can be approved and changes can be implemented.

2. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that takes other functions as parameters and can return functions (ie they operate on other functions). They fall under a type of programming know as function programming, where everything is coded in terms of functions. These functions are contrasted with first-order functions, which the functions we've learned about in the LEARN prep courses.

3. Jest: Jest is a Javascript testing framework which verifies whether or not a code is written correctly. It involves using an API to write tests for your code. I don't really understand what an API is, though I am researching it to understand it better.

4. Objects: Objects are a type of data structure which uses key-value pairs as a format to store data. This is contrasted to arrays which only store one data-type per position (though an array can be used inside an array to store multiple values).

5. Classes: Classes are a means to construct objects. They are kind of like functions, though they need to have their values defined before they can be called. To be honest I don't fully understand how they work yet. Still trying to research this.
